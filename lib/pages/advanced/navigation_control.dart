Giving you as much control as possible over what happens when a route changes is a core principle of VRouter.

To achieve such control, five functions can be used in various places: beforeLeave, beforeEnter, beforeUpdate, afterEnter, afterUpdate.
These function have different scope depending on where they are specified: 
    • Global if specified in the VRouter (i.e. they will always be called)
    • Route specific if specified in a VGuard
    • Widget specific by using VWidgetGuard''',

The navigation cycle is the list of events which happen when a user navigates from a route to another. The cycle is important to understand as it allows you to better manage your navigation control.

When you try to navigate, here is what will happen:    
  1. Call beforeLeave in all deactivated [VWidgetGuard]
  2. Call beforeLeave in all deactivated [VRouteElement]
  3. Call beforeLeave in the [VRouter]
  4. Call beforeEnter in the [VRouter]
  5. Call beforeEnter in all initialized [VRouteElement] of the new route
  6. Call beforeUpdate in all reused [VRouteElement]

  ## The history state got in beforeLeave are stored
  ## The state is updated

  7. Call afterEnter in all initialized [VWidgetGuard]
  8. Call afterEnter all initialized [VRouteElement]
  9. Call afterEnter in the [VRouter]
  10. Call afterUpdate in all reused [VWidgetGuard]
  11. Call afterUpdate in all reused [VRouteElement]


Deactivated are those which were in the previousRoute but not in the new one.
Reused are those which were in the previousRoute and in the new one.
Initialized are those which were not in the previousRoute but are in the new one.

beforeLeave, beforeEnter and beforeUpdate function return a future which will be awaited. 

In beforeLeave, beforeEnter and beforeUpdate, you can stop the navigation cycle by using VRedirector. However do NOT use context.vRouter to redirect in those functions.''',
