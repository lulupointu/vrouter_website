There are different VRouteElement classes based on your needs:
    • VWidget is the most basic: it allows you to map a path to a widget
    • VNester which is like VWidget, but also enable widget nesting
    • VGuard which allows you to react to navigation changes
    • …

The most interesting part of VRouter is everything it does automatically for you that you don’t have to worry about. 

In the example above:
    • There are transitions between the routes, which is adapted to each platform. You will be able to customize it later of course
    • On the web, the browser back/forward button and the url are handled as you would expect

For now however, the only way to navigate is by typing a new url. Not very practical, especially on mobile! In the next chapter, ''',
